## Recent Changes

#### v1.0

##### v1.0.4
* knobs_into_holes.KnobGroup.from_helices now works as expected with large cutoff values. Testing added accordingly.

##### v1.0.3
* The `settings.json` file is no more!
    * It has been replaced with `.isambard_settings` which is written to the users home directory

##### v1.0.2
* Added files for managing the install using pip or `setup.py`
    * Can now download and run `python setup.py install` in the `isambard_dev` file to install to your python packages

##### v1.0.1
* Added checks for external program availability
    * Will now raise a `DependencyNotFoundWarning` if a function that requires an external program is called without that dependency being available

##### v1.0.0
* Release API structure
    * All parametric model building is now in the specifications folder under either assembly_specs or polymer_specs
    * From this point out, the version number in the development branch will follow full [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)

#### v0.7

##### v0.7.2
* Added C5 hydrogen bond
    * As defined by Newberry & Raines (Nat Chem Biol 2016)
    * `isambard.ampal.interactions.find_C5HydrogenBonds(ampal)`
    * Unit tests included

##### v0.7.1
* Added `radius_of_gyration` function
* Added 'ignore_hydrogens' flag to `get_atoms()`
* Updated unit tests

##### v0.7.0
* New force field assignment structure
    * Now uses the `update_ff` method to manage caching and updating force field parameters

#### v0.6

##### v0.6.0-0.6.6
* Fixed a bug where the `TAPolypeptie` did not assign the `ampal_parent` attribute during `build`
* `coiledcoil.py`
    * Fixed coiled-coil interface angles in basis set parameters
* `relabel_monomers`
    * Added option for relabelling monomers by an integer value as well as a list of labels
* Fix for `Optimizers` on Windows
    * Will now use `map` rather than `futures.ProcessPoolExecutor().map` if the platform is Windows or only a single core is used
* Minor bug-fix
     * Caught potential error in loop-closure method
* New BUFF Structure
    * All AMPAL objects should now be picklable after scoring
    * BUFF runs 33-50% faster
* Updated interactions.py with non-covalent interaction classes and methods for identifying them
    * N->pi* interactions
    * Cation->pi interactions
    * Simple salt bridge interactions
    * Methionine-aromatic interactions
    * Pi-Pi interactions
    * Hydrogen bonds with C-H group as a donor
