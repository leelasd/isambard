## Recent Changes

#### v1.3
##### v1.3.0
* New TALE modelling specifications
    * Can model as stand alone proteins or as pairs of TALEs bound to DNA
* Updated `__repr__` of `Assembly`

#### v1.2
#### v1.2.0 - 1.2.1
* Reworked imports to make them more consistent
* Added DFire2 potential

#### v1.1
##### v1.1.0 - 1.1.8
* Added GOAP optimization into the GA
* Batch method for running GOAP
* Restructured the scoring optimiser slightl to allow for alternate scoring functions to be more easily used
* Added GOAP - Generalized Orientation-Dependent All-Atom Statistical Potential for protein structure prediction
    * Incorporates DFIRE potential and this can be accessed independently
    * Run using `isambard.external_programs.run_goap(pdb_file, path=True)`, or it will take an `ampal.pdb` object with path=False.
* Added new optimizer classes GA_Opt_Internal and DE_Opt_Internal that will optimize on the BUFF internal energy.
* Functionality that has now been moved to isocket repository (https://github.com/woolfson-group/isocket) has been removed.
* Deleted:
    * coeus database folder (3 modules)
    * graph_theory and test_graph_theory
    * get_protein_dict_from_cif
* knobs_into_holes now uses clustering instead of gen_sectors, which is no longer imported.
* Import now tests presence of dssp with `--version` flag to prevent import hang in jupyter notebook on windows systems
* `BuffForceField` now has a setter for the `distance_cutoff` property, which will overwrite the default cutoff
* Reworked internals of BUFF to find interactions in a more general way
    * Now has a `score_inter_ampal` function in `isambard.buff` that allows interaction energy to be measured between multiple AMPAL

#### v1.0
##### v1.0.0 - 1.0.4
* knobs_into_holes.KnobGroup.from_helices now works as expected with large cutoff values. Testing added accordingly.
* The `settings.json` file is no more!
    * It has been replaced with `.isambard_settings` which is written to the users home directory
* Added files for managing the install using pip or `setup.py`
    * Can now download and run `python setup.py install` in the `isambard_dev` file to install to your python packages
* Added checks for external program availability
    * Will now raise a `DependencyNotFoundWarning` if a function that requires an external program is called without that dependency being available
* Release API structure
    * All parametric model building is now in the specifications folder under either assembly_specs or polymer_specs
    * From this point out, the version number in the development branch will follow full [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)

#### v0.7
##### v0.7.0 - 0.7.2
* Added C5 hydrogen bond
    * As defined by Newberry & Raines (Nat Chem Biol 2016)
    * `isambard.ampal.interactions.find_C5HydrogenBonds(ampal)`
    * Unit tests included
* Added `radius_of_gyration` function
* Added 'ignore_hydrogens' flag to `get_atoms()`
* Updated unit tests
* New force field assignment structure
    * Now uses the `update_ff` method to manage caching and updating force field parameters
