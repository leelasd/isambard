## Recent Changes

#### v0.7

##### v0.7.1
* Added `radius_of_gyration` function
* Added 'ignore_hydrogens' flag to `get_atoms()`
* Updated unit tests

##### v0.7.0
* New force field assignment structure
    * Now uses the `update_ff` method to manage caching and updating force field parameters

#### v0.6

##### v0.6.0-0.6.6
* Fixed a bug where the `TAPolypeptie` did not assign the `ampal_parent` attribute during `build`
* `coiledcoil.py`
    * Fixed coiled-coil interface angles in basis set parameters
* `relabel_monomers`
    * Added option for relabelling monomers by an integer value as well as a list of labels
* Fix for `Optimizers` on Windows
    * Will now use `map` rather than `futures.ProcessPoolExecutor().map` if the platform is Windows or only a single core is used
* Minor bug-fix
     * Caught potential error in loop-closure method
* New BUFF Structure
    * All AMPAL objects should now be picklable after scoring
    * BUFF runs 33-50% faster
* Updated interactions.py with non-covalent interaction classes and methods for identifying them
    * N->pi* interactions
    * Cation->pi interactions
    * Simple salt bridge interactions
    * Methionine-aromatic interactions
    * Pi-Pi interactions
    * Hydrogen bonds with C-H group as a donor

#### v0.5.0
* Added BUDE 2016 Force Field
    * Currently is not the default force field so must be enabled by editing the `settings.json` file or rerunning `configure.py`
    * Bug fixes have also been included so that the default force field now works as intended

#### v0.4.0
* Loop Closure Functionality
    * Functions for performing kinematic closure of loops have now been added to `isambard.ampal.loops`
    * This module uses Metropolis Monte Carlo backbone moves to fit a loop between two regions of protein
    * The major function is `isambard.loops.fit_loop_between`
* `join` method has now been separated into `n_join` and `c_join`
* Socket
    * Socket functionality is now completely replicated using native ISAMBARD code
    * The Socket external dependency has been removed

#### v0.3.1
* New PDB Parser
    * Much more robust
    * Allows preprocessing of the PDB file
    * Easy to add filters to the parsering of the PDB and the generation of the AMPAL object
* Automatic configuration script `configure.py` added
    * This generates the settings.json file using user information
    * Use `python configure.py` to run
    * Add the `-o` flag if you have existing settings you wish to overwrite
* `settings.json` has a new general format
* [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) has been linked to the ISAMBARD repository
    * This is a tool for [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
    * Whenever changes are pushed to master CircleCI downloads ISAMBARD and runs the unit tests
    * There is a badge in the `README.md` detailing the current CircleCI status
